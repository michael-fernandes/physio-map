# Physio Map
Communicating fall risk to persons undergoing physical rehabilitation late in their life presents a unique challenge. Falls for Geriatric persons can result in serious injury and even fatality, presenting a dire need to motivate successful rehabilitation.
Using standardized data, this projects aims to create reference points for whether a patient remains at risk for falling based on how peers of similar age preformed on Geriatric Movement and Balance Assessments. By communicating these reference points patients through a patient-centered app, we hope to find better health outcomes pre and post evaluation (usually a period of 8 weeks).
